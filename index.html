<!-- Introduction -->
<h1 id="name"><center> AutoRich-TTS </center></h1>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
    <p>
    Text-prompted Text-To-Speech has emerged as a novel paradigm, which using text descriptions as speaking style prompts to guide speech synthesis.
    However, achieving optimal control demands exhaustive fine-grained style descriptions. This necessity imposes significant burden on users, where inadequate or coarse inputs often result in degraded synthesis quality.
    To address this, we propose AutoRich-TTS, a two-stage framework automatically enriches user simple prompts into fine-grained descriptions.
    Specifically, the first stage extrapolates contextual information to extend implicit style cues.
    The second stage generates richer style descriptions from coarse inputs and inferred context, enhancing both stylistic detail and expressiveness. Finally autoregressive speech language model synthesizes speech conditioned on refined prompts.
    Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively bridges the gap between user inputs and high-quality acoustic realization.

<h2 id="">Automatic Prompt Enrichment</h2>

<p>
  Our method enables the LLM to infer implicit context information and intent from the input text, dynamically adjusting the style of synthesized speech.
  Specifically, we use the LLM to generate Extrapolated Context surrounding sentences that encompass the topic and scenario of the Input Text.
  Then, a Coarse-grained Style Description serves as initial guidance, which combined with Extrapolated Context, helps generate Fine-grained Style Description with greater nuance and expressiveness.
  Finally, we pass the Extrapolated Context and the Input Text through the Context Compression module to obtain the Paragraph-level Semantic Prompt, which is combined with the Fine-grained Style Description to guide the TTS model to output expressive speech that meets user expectations.

  We conduct thorough ablation experiments to validate the contributions of different settings of AutoRich-TTS.
