<p align="justify">

Recent advances in using text descriptions as prompts to guide
speech synthesis tasks have garnered significant attention. Text-
Prompt-Based Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems require users to pro-
vide fine-grained style descriptions as much as possible to achieve
optimal speech synthesis control. However, due to varying levels
of user expressiveness, some inadequate style descriptions may
negatively impact the quality of synthesized speech. Compared to
fine-grained style descriptions, allowing users to provide a coarse-
grained style description significantly lowers the usage barrier and
enhances the overall user experience. In this paper, we propose
Auto-Enrichment Text-To-Speech (AE-TTS), a two-stage pipeline
that automatically converts user-provided coarse-grained style de-
scriptions into enriched fine-grained ones. Specifically, the first
stage infers the contextual information of the input text based
on the coarse-grained style description, automatically extracting
implicit emotional tendencies, scene characteristics, and thematic
features. In the second stage, guided by the coarse-grained style
description and the inferred contextual information, the system
generates fine-grained style descriptions, making them more de-
tailed and expressive. Finally, we adopt autoregressive generation
paradigm to guide speech synthesis with given context and refined
style descriptions as prompts.The entire process is powered by large
language models (LLMs). Through both subjective and objective
evaluations, we successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in controllable expressive speech generation tasks.

<h2 id="diversity">Automatic Prompt Enrichment</h2>

<p><ruby>Our method enables the
LLM to infer implicit information and intent from the input text’s
context, dynamically adjusting the style and content of synthesized
speech. Specifically, we use the LLM to generate Extrapolated Con-
text surrounding sentences that encompass the topic and scenario
of the Input Text. Then, a Coarse-grained Style Description serves
as initial guidance, which, when combined with Extrapolated Con-
text, helps generate Fine-grained Style Description with greater
nuance and expressiveness. Finally, we pass the Extrapolated Con-
text and the Input Text through the Context Compression module
to obtain the Paragraph-level Semantic Prompt, which is combined
with the Fine-grained Style Description to guide the TTS model to
output expressive speech that meets expectations.</ruby></p>
